# Image Steganography

Image steganography is the process of encrypting or decrypting the data in the image. By the help
of this we can easily hide our message and assign a particular key to decrypt the data from the
steganographed image.
This project is the result of teamwork, I have given the idea and also contributed in the coding stuff
of the project.
